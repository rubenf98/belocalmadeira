            "Be Local Madeira was created from a simple desire — to share the Madeira we grew up with, the one that lives beyond the postcards. The quiet valleys where time seems to pause. The crystal-clear waters that change with the tides. The mountains that greet the sunrise before anyone else. And the ocean… always alive, always powerful.",
            "Our mission is to take you there — safely, passionately, and with the warmth of true local hospitality. From canyoning and coasteering to hiking and biking, every adventure is guided by certified professionals who know the island’s moods, its hidden paths, and the most magical corners to explore.",
            (<>With us, you won’t just visit Madeira. <br /> You’ll feel Madeira. <br /> You’ll understand its rhythms, breathe its silence, and experience its wild beauty the way locals do — with respect, curiosity, and a sense of wonder. </>),
            "Guests often tell us it feels like discovering the island with old friends. And that’s exactly what we strive for: authentic moments, meaningful memories, and adventures that stay with you long after your feet leave the ground.",
            (<> Whether it’s your first time or your fiftieth, Madeira has a story to tell. <br /> We’re here to help you live it. </>),
